The site/logs directory will contain logs written by the bbwrap shell wrapper on each host.

The logs directory must have permissions 777 so that any user running a job on the remote
host can write the log file, as the wrapper is running as that user (if all users are in the
same group, permisson of 775 are ok too).  

Each host will create a file called <hostname>.jobs.log

Logs look like this:

02/03/17 Job zbox1.2328 for buildit took 60 seconds ran:sleep 60

If the user terminates a command (through control-c):

02/03/17 Job zbox1.3261 for buildit took 3 seconds terminated:-c sleep 60
